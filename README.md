# tf2template
template for collaboration for NLP with tf2.0 

## Motivation
Design pattern is the language of programmer. This template tries to alleviate the pain of team collaboration. 
It is based on the tf.keras module, and the principle behind the design is to decouple subworks in a machine learning.

The template provides a tradeoff between flexibility and convenience. Most of the classed are inherated from the ABC in tf.keras
